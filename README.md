*(download link in data folder as files to big to host on github)*

All of this analysis was performed using [ULTRA-VISTA catalog data](https://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/galaxyevolution/ULTRAVISTA/Ultravista/K-selected.html), Galaxy Zoo Hubble (GZH) Morpholgy data, Overdensity data from Darvish et al (2015) [1].

* ```GalaxyZoo.fits``` Obtained from Brooke Simmons - GZH data - note this does not include debiased vote fractions, in orted to select a good sample of galaxy with particular feature see GZH paper [3].

* ```Darvish2015.xml``` Obtained from the Darvish et al (2015) paper [1] - relevant column is 'logdel' which is the overdensity values $\log(1+\delta)$. Note this overdensity was calculated using a technique called Voronoi Tessellation.

* ```UVISTA_full_v4.1.fits``` Obtaied from the ULTRAVISTA data product downloads page linked above (K-selected). This is all data product downloads stiched together. The paper corresponding to this data is [2]. See table below detailing relevant columns names and descriptions

| VmJ                | V - J rest frame colour           | Calculated using the EAZY code. Note no errors, this is addressed later |
| UmV                | U - V rest frame colour           | Calcualted using the EAZY code. Note no errors, this is addressed later |
| USE_1              | Flag                              | This selects galaxies with good photometry S/N > 5.    |

The catalog also contains apeture fluxes for many bands with errors. Other data files are combinated of the above files, and are named apropriately. They were matched equally with TOPCAT by ra and dec with error +- 3.0.



``muzzing2013Fig9/``

* ``idl.mplstyle`` Makes the python plots look waaaay better :)

*  ``Muzzin2013Fig9Morph.pdf`` This is a recreated version of Figure 9 from Muzzing et al (2013) [2]. With GZH morphology overlaid. We colour galaxies with P_{feature} > 0.7 in Blue and and galaxies with P_{smooth} > 0.8 in red. The dividing green line separates Star-forming and Quiescent galaxies, this line is taken from a follow-up paper by the same author [citation needed]. We only include the first two redshift bins as for z > 1 we dont have a significant volume of GZH classifications.

``starpy/``

All analysis in this section was done with a modified version of starpy. The only place this code was changed was the filter specific part. Where filters where reaplced with the corrected filters for the COSMOS survey. This code was run on the Glamdring compute cluster, and the output saved to my account. The way starpy is run is exactly the same as the original code wich can be found [here](https://github.com/rjsmethurst/starpy).

All required modules are intalled correctly on my glamdring account.

To run this code for many galaxies on glamdring you will need to create a ``params.txt`` file and save it in the same directory as ``starpy.py``. ``params.txt should have the following format:

```
python3 starpy.py VmJ(1) err_VmJ(1) UmV(1) err_UmV(1) z(1) ID(1) ra(1) dec(1)
python3 starpy.py VmJ(2) err_VmJ(2) UmV(2) err_UmV(2) z(2) ID(2) ra(2) dec(2)
.           .               .           .         .         .    .     .     .
.           .               .           .         .         .    .     .     .
.           .               .           .         .         .    .     .     .
```

The VmJ values have a standard error of 0.139951, and the UmV error have a value of 0.099356. These values were calculated in the following way. Noticing that the errors in apature flux for U,V and J bands are relatively small in ```UVISTA_full_v4.1.fits```, the main source of error comes from the calculation of rest frame colours using the EAZY code. We calculate errors using the error template funciton for the EAZY code found in Brammer et al (2006)[7], Figure 3. We used the Effective mid point wavelenghts of the U, V and J bands (365, 551, 1220nm) to find the errror in flux using Fig 3 of [7], this was then propigated to find the error in magnitude resulting in the above values.

ID is the row number in the main GZ+UVISTA.fits table and is used to match output to galaxy zoo morphology to weight output.

Running the multirun smethhurst command in this directory with a queue and number of nodes specfied will run starpy for each of the set of params in params.txt deleteing rows in param.txt when the have been computed and output saved. An exaple of a run command is below

```
addqueuecmb "mulit-run" 2 /usr/local/shared/bin/multirunsmethurst
```
adds a job to th cmb queue using 2 cores, runing all the sets of parameters found in ``params.txt``.

I've run this over the whole COMSMOS sample that we have GZH morphologies for. Saved on my glamdring account is the following output. Walker positions named as:

```samples_....```

and coresponding logrithmic probabilities named as 

`````lnprob_...```
